# Express App Generator for MERN / MEAN / MEVN apps


# Steps to run
1. clone repository
2. run `npm install` in project directory
3. Paste your static files in public directory
3. `npm start` in project directory
4. Server will start on http://localhost:3000

This server will serve all static files from public folder. You can create a react-app, angular app or Vue and after running `npm run build` copy the static files in public folder. or you can change the path of static files to build or dist in `app.js` file.

If there any issues in the repository, or you want to upgrade the code structure, just send a PR, & I will look into it.

Happy Cracking!
